## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are a leading cause of mortality globally. Early prediction and accurate analysis can play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack and provides meaningful insights from the data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Prediction of heart attack risk
- Data visualization for analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. that are relevant to heart health.

## Model

I used multiple machine-learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict the risk of a heart attack. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using relevant metrics.

## Results

Compared the results obtained from all five techniques and SVM performed the best among the five.
